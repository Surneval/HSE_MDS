    "## Ticket agregator program\n",
    "\n",
    "Hello!\n",
    "This is a programe of ticket agrarator (some small part of what good ticket agregator must consist of) developped by **Nadezhda Trusova, HSE MDS-1 student**.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Input\n",
    "\n",
    "Program asks user for data input about ticket characteristics:\n",
    "1) the ticket price\n",
    "2) the number of transfers\n",
    "3) refund (yes or no)\n",
    "4) luggage (yes or no)\n",
    "\n",
    "Program checks wether data input is correct and transforms each input into right format.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Main program algorythm\n",
    "\n",
    "Program checks four parameters inputed by user and define the category of the ticket:\n",
    "1) If price is less than 200; it is either a direct flight or a flight with one transfer; refund is included; luggage is included, we get **\"The best offer\"** category;\n",
    "2) If price is in a range from 200 to 250; it's either a dicrect flight or has one or two transfers; refund is either included or not, luggage is either included or not, we get **\"Good enough\"** category;\n",
    "3) If price is more than 250; three and more transfers; refund is either included or not, luggage is either included or not, we get **\"The worst offer\"**\n",
    "\n",
    "### Output\n",
    "\n",
    "You will get summary of the characteristics you have entered and the category of the ticket."

    "## Proposed agregator analysis\n",
    "The proposed agregator model is good and I found it cinvincing (such criteria as price, transfers, luggage and refund are important), but still there are some issues to upgrade. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Advantages\n",
    "1) I find it useful. It helps you to determine the quality of your ticket based on the most popular criteria:\n",
    "\n",
    "* price\n",
    "* number of transfers\n",
    "* luggage (included or not)\n",
    "* refund (included or not)\n",
    "\n",
    "2) It is easy to use and easy to fix the program if something goes wrong - just look through short python script;\n",
    "\n",
    "3) It provides short and clear outcome: category and key characteristics;\n",
    "\n",
    "4) It checks user input and if it's incorrect tells about it and asks user to try again till the input is correct;\n",
    "\n",
    "### Disadvantages\n",
    "1) There can be different treshholds for price and quantity of connection flights (transfers) for different people. It is better to ask user for price - **the first price target** and **the second price target**, for transfers - **the first transfers targer** and **the second transfers target**;\n",
    "2) For some people the luggage is not important. It is better to ask the user for this information;\n",
    "3) For some people the refund is not important. It is better to ask the user for this information;\n",
    "4) For Russian users I would add one more criteria: Russian cards/ payment systems\n",
    "\n",
    "To sum it up it would be better to determine categories for the user based on his input on such criteria in the beggining. \n"

    "## Alternative solution\n",
    "Let's use similar model as in the original agrerator model, we are analyzing tickets for the destination Moscow - New York.\n",
    "\n",
    "Aggregator askes about price trashhold, noticing average price range - the first price target and the second price target, But the user still can propose his personal price range - **the first price target** and **the second price target**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Than the agregator askes the user how many transfers are exceptable for you? User enters a number, this number is accounted in the 'best offer', number + 1 is accounted in 'good offer', bad offer has more than number + 1 transfers.\n",
    "\n",
    "Than aggregetor askes user \"Is rufund important\". If the answer is \"yes\" - aggregator creates refund as one of the parameters of \"The best\" and \"Good\" options.\n",
    "\n",
    "Than aggregetor askes user \"Is luggage important\". If the answer is \"yes\" - aggregator creates refund as one of the parameters of \"The best\" and \"Good\" options.\n",
    "\n",
    "Aggregator creates the following categories:\n",
    "\n",
    "1) \"The best offer\" is the one which costs less the the first price target; the number of transfers is less or equal to the number from user input, if refund is important for the user, refund is included; if luggage is important for the user the luggage is included.\n",
    "2) \"Good enough offer\": ticket price is in range between the first price target and the second price target; the number of transfers is less or equal to the number + 2 (from user input); if luggage is important for the user thr luggage is included, refund is either included or not.\n",
    "3) \"Bad offer\":ticket price is over the second price target; the number of transfers is more than number + 2 (from user input); luggage is either included or not, refund is either included or not.\n",
    "4) \"Other\" if the option differs from three options above\n",
    "\n",
    "In the output the user gets information about the category and short summary of flight details (price, number of transfers, information about the luggage and about the refund)."
